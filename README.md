## Partial Early Payment Feature

This feature allows users to calculate the impact of partial early payments on their loan schedule. Partial early payments reduce the remaining principal, decrease the interest accrued in subsequent periods, and may recalculate the monthly payment amount or shorten the loan term.

### Usage Instructions

1. Enter the loan amount, annual interest rate, loan term (in months), and start date.
2. Enter the partial early payment amount and the date of the early payment.
3. Click the "Oblicz" button to generate the loan schedule and see the impact of the partial early payment.

The loan schedule will display the monthly payments, interest payments, principal payments, and the remaining principal for each month. The summary section will show the total cost of the loan, the total interest paid, the regular monthly payment, the first and last payments, and the impact of the partial early payment.
